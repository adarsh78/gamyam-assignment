[Live site here](https://gamyam-assignment-adarsh.netlify.app/)

This App Contains all the data in the provided json file. Will all the functionalities mentioned.

Users can toggle theme based on their preferences, can view the products as a grid as well tabular format.

Users can add or edit the products based on their requirement.

And for optimization I have implemented pagination as well.

I have a theme toggle functionality and made this assignment responsive as well using TailwindCSS.

Used localstorage for storing the theme and view format state, so that it can be persists even on page refresh or closing tab.

I have used react-icons npm library for the necessary icons required in the assignment.
